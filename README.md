*aka "The WORST Baldi's Basics Mod I've Ever Played.." according to grays and land... (don't worry though, he just REALLY hates playtime)*

A decently sized and modular Baldi's Basics Plus mod that adds content with no rhyme or reason, usually requested by members in the Baldi GameBanana section and/or reinterpretations of characters from mods/fan games from the past.
